# Space Invaders is a 1978 shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Taito for arcades.
# It was released in Japan in April 1978, with the game being released by Midway Manufacturing overseas. 
# Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter, the sequel to the Atari 2600's Pong and the first video game with endless gameplay (meaning there was no final level or endscreen) and set the template for the genre.
# The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser cannon to earn as many points as possible.
